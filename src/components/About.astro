const about = `I am Reza, a _front-end developer_, open-source enthusiast, and tech advisor.

I started my career as a _PHP developer_, and later switched to _Javascript_ as my main language when _jQuery_ and _Mootools_ were at the height of their popularity.

I've worked with many _server-side_ languages and have a good understanding of all related technologies, which gives me a versatile and unbiased point of view.

I'm _solution-oriented_ and value reliability and speed above everything else. So Iâ€™m committed to delivering projects according to the designated _timelines_ without compromising _code quality_.

As a frontend developer I've focused on _web_ development and _mobile_ applications, but still have an interest in _Backend_ and _DevOps_, and try to grow my skills one step at a time and expand my knowledge base.
