  about: `I am Reza, a senior _frontend developer_, an open-source enthusiast, and a tech advisor.

  I started my career as a _PHP developer_, later on I learned _Javascript_ when _jQuery_ and _Mootools_ where at the height of their popularity. 

  I've also worked with many _server-side_ languages and have a good understanding of all technologies, which gives me a versatile and unbiased point of view. 

  I'm _solution-oriented_ and value reliability and speed above everything else. This means I am committed to deliver according to the project _timeline_ without any compromises in _code quality_.

  As a frontend developer I've focused on _web_ and _mobile_, but still have an interest in _Backend_ and _DevOps_, and try to grow my skills one step at a time and expand my knowledge base.`,
